[ ] CONFIGURATION, PROFILES

SPRING BOOT
[ ] STARTER PROJECT, APPLICATION.PROPERTIES/YML
[ ] CONTROLLERS: @RESTCONTROLLER, @REQUESTMAPPING
[ ] REQUEST/RESPONSE: @REQUESTBODY, @PATHVARIABLE, @REQUESTPARAM
[ ] VALIDATION: @VALID, BEAN VALIDATION ANNOTATIONS
[ ] GLOBAL EXCEPTION HANDLING: @CONTROLLERADVICE

DATA LAYER

[ ] ENTITIES, RELATIONSHIPS (ONE-TO-MANY, MANY-TO-MANY)
[ ] REPOSITORIES, CRUD
[ ] FETCH TYPES, CASCADE
[ ] JPQL, DERIVED QUERIES
[ ] MIGRATIONS: FLYWAY OR LIQUIBASE

TESTING
[ ] JUNIT, MOCKITO
[ ] SPRING BOOT TEST, MOCKMVC

PHASE 5: SECURITY (BACKEND MUST) (2-4 WEEKS)

[ ] SPRING SECURITY BASICS
[ ] AUTHENTICATION VS AUTHORIZATION
[ ] PASSWORD HASHING (BCrypt)
[ ] JWT (TOKEN BASED AUTH)
[ ] ROLE BASED ACCESS (ADMIN/USER)

PHASE 6: PRODUCTION PRACTICES (3-6 WEEKS)

CLEAN CODE + ARCHITECTURE
[ ] LAYERS: CONTROLLER -> SERVICE -> REPOSITORY
[ ] DTOs, MAPPERS
[ ] SOLID PRINCIPLES (PRACTICAL)
[ ] DESIGN PATTERNS (FACTORY, BUILDER, SINGLETON, STRATEGY)

PERFORMANCE + RELIABILITY
[ ] LOGGING (SLF4J/LOGBACK)
[ ] PAGINATION + SORTING
[ ] CACHING (REDIS IDEA)
[ ] RATE LIMITING IDEA
[ ] ASYNC + SCHEDULING ( @ASYNC, @SCHEDULED )

OBSERVABILITY
[ ] ACTUATOR
[ ] METRICS/TRACING IDEA

PHASE 7: DEVOPS LIGHT (DEPLOYMENT) (2-4 WEEKS)

[ ] DOCKER BASICS + DOCKERFILE
[ ] ENV VARIABLES + SECRETS
[ ] BUILD JAR + RUN ON SERVER
[ ] CI/CD IDEA (GITHUB ACTIONS)
[ ] CLOUD DEPLOY (BASIC): RENDER/RAILWAY/AWS/GCP IDEA

PHASE 8: PROJECTS (THIS MAKES YOU HIREABLE) (ONGOING)

PROJECT 1 (BEGINNER)
[ ] TODO REST API (CRUD) + VALIDATION + EXCEPTIONS

PROJECT 2 (INTERMEDIATE)
[ ] E-COMMERCE MINI BACKEND
[ ] USERS, PRODUCTS, CART, ORDERS
[ ] JWT AUTH + ROLES
[ ] PAGINATION + SEARCH
[ ] SWAGGER DOCS

PROJECT 3 (ADVANCED)
[ ] BOOKING SYSTEM / FOOD DELIVERY / LEARNING PLATFORM
[ ] MICROSERVICE IDEA (OPTIONAL)
[ ] REDIS CACHE (OPTIONAL)
[ ] DOCKER + DEPLOY
[ ] TESTS + LOGGING + ACTUATOR

GITHUB MUST
[ ] CLEAN README (SETUP + API EXAMPLES)
[ ] POSTMAN COLLECTION
[ ] DATABASE SCHEMA
[ ] DEPLOYED LINK (IF POSSIBLE)

FINAL INTERVIEW CHECKLIST

[ ] CAN DESIGN REST API ENDPOINTS CLEANLY
[ ] CAN WRITE SPRING BOOT CRUD + VALIDATION + EXCEPTION HANDLING
[ ] STRONG SQL + JOINS + TRANSACTIONS
[ ] JWT AUTH IMPLEMENTATION UNDERSTANDING
[ ] KNOWS COLLECTIONS/STREAMS WELL
[ ] CAN EXPLAIN JPA RELATIONSHIPS + FETCHING
[ ] CAN DO BASIC DOCKER + DEPLOY

IF YOU TELL ME YOUR DAILY TIME (3H OR 4H) + WHEN YOUR MIDSEM IS,
I WILL CONVERT THIS INTO A WEEK-WISE PLAN (WITH DAILY TASKS + MINI PROJECTS).
